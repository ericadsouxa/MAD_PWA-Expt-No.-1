Experiment No 1: First Flutter App
During this experiment, we acquired knowledge about the scaffold layout, widget hierarchy, and diverse widgets such as Text, TextStyle, Font, Image, Assets, Icons, Padding, and Center, among others.

# About the Experiment 

In the first experiment of creating a Flutter application, we were introduced to the fundamentals of constructing a user interface using widgets. Our initial step was to create a scaffold layout, which serves as a fundamental structure for a Flutter application that establishes the groundwork for implementing a Material Design-style interface.

Furthermore, we gained an understanding of the widget hierarchy in Flutter, a tree-like structure that defines the composition of a user interface. Widgets can function as parents or children of other widgets, and this hierarchy determines the layout and appearance of the user interface.

Throughout the experiment, we explored a diverse range of widgets, including Text, TextStyle, Font, Image, Assets, Icons, Padding, and Center. These widgets enabled us to incorporate text, images, and icons into our user interface while controlling their positioning, size, and styling.

Overall, this experiment provided us with a solid foundation for creating more intricate Flutter applications in the future. With the knowledge gained from this experiment, we can construct captivating and visually appealing user interfaces for our applications.
